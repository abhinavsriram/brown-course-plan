      "Course Description": "An introduction to theoretical and methodological issues in the study of language and social life. We begin by examining semiotic approaches to language. We turn to classical research on language as a structured system - covering such topics as phonology and grammatical categories - but we focus on the implications of such work for broader social scientific and humanistic research. We then consider areas of active contemporary research, including cognition and linguistic relativity, meaning and semantics, pronouns and deixis, deference and register, speech acts and performativity, interaction, verbal art and poetics, reported speech, performance, and linguistic ideology.",

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span Р the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease Р has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" Р the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature.

The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making.",

Blame is often assigned to specific politicians or ideological perspectives. Public choice economics instead analyzes the incentive structure within which political decisions take place, seeking to uncover the forces guiding the behavior of voters, legislators, judges, and other political agents. This course will examine the insights and limitations of the public choice perspective in the context of electoral politics, legislation, bureaucracy and regulation, and constitutional rules.",

This course explores the scientific literatures that emerged in the wake of Spanish conquest and colonization of the Americas (1500-1800). These hybrid scientific literatures, written in Spanish but also in Nahuatl, Maya, Quechua and graphic forms, illustrate the lasting cross-pollination between Old and New World notions about American nature.",

How is piracy related to other historical processes, notably imperialism and nation-building? What explains the resurgence of piracy in the twenty-first century? Why have pirates become the stuff of legend, and how accurately are they portrayed in books and films?",

In surveying this important transitional period, we will pay particular attention to far-reaching changes in the nation's business and economic life, its social movements, as well as its cultural developments, all with an eye to understanding how the United States became one of the world's most commanding economic, political, and cultural powers.",

Both Jewish and Christian texts used gender to explore new ways of constructing heroic women and men that either re-inscribed or challenged traditional roles.

Since Jewish family life was very much under the control of Jewish women, the family was another place where women were able to wield power. Examining the history of gender and family allows us to examine the limits of patriarchal control and construct a new, often surprising picture of how Jewish society actually functioned. It also sheds new light on how the various forms of modern Jewish family we recognize today grew and developed.",

In addition to translating from Greek into English, we will read and discuss essays on translation, in order to consider in an informed way the issues (untranslatability?) and types of decision making associated with the practice of translation. Three years of study of MGRK at Brown (equivalent of MGRK 0600) or elsewhere. A placement test may be necessary.",

He was at the same a powerful though elusive personality who continues to inspire critical controversy. We will examine his creative evolution in the context of the history of popular music taste, race relations, gender roles, and social class in America.

Is such questioning merely a confusion resulting from misuse of language? This course will survey writings on nothing, with particular attention to the problem of ineffability. We will develop necessary skills to come to terms with and rationally argue about obscure topics and challenging texts.",

Its premise is that Afro-Theisms, not the institutional \"Black Church\" or Black prophetic religion, have been seminal to the self-conception of Black people and their way of constituting racial \"others\". Different theistic emphasis at different historical moments demonstrates both the importance and fluidity of Afro-Theisms and sheds unique light on quest for equity and self-actualization. Starting with the conventional Christian theologies into which New World Africans under slave conditions were indoctrinated, this course will explore the role and impact of Afro-Theisms.",

The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace �Black Power?� What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions.",

Arguably Africa�s most prolific and controversial artist of the twentieth century, Fela continues to be invoked as musical genius and as icon of popular struggle. This course invites students to explore the complexities of Fela�s art and activism. We mobilize his life/work as a springboard for examining emergent debates about African identity�from postcolonial masculinity to the creative logics of African cities, from contemporary African youth culture to the gendered politics of cultural memory.",

Given an adequate amount of data, these models can extract meaningful representations to perform accurate predictions. The collection of vast quantities of biological data naturally leads to the question -- can deep learning help us understand genomics? In this seminar-style class, we will cover the recent research literature trying to answer this question. We will learn how state-of-the-art models like CNNs, RNNs, GCNs, GANs, etc. have been applied to solve significant problems in genomics and what unique challenges are presented by the data in this field.

Its collapse in the late 19c left a mark on the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, the art of Gustav Klimt, and the fiction of Franz Kafka. Liberalism's second collapse in the 1930s, inspired the founder of neoliberal economics Friedrich Hayek and the philosopher of science Karl Popper. These men were all Austrian, a nationality they shared with the most infamous critic of liberalism, Adolf Hitler. This course wonders why this country in the center of Europe has exercised such an outsized influence on our modern experience.",

The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.\n\nAlthough students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.",

Yet their lasting power—from “There She Is” to Toddlers & Tiaras to pageant waves—is undeniable. What accounts for their enduring power? This course draws on inter-disciplinary scholarship to examine how and why pageantry and American femininity have become linked in the public consciousness as they transformed from beauty contests to the largest source of scholarship money available to women in this country. We will examine how pageantry intersects with major institutions—education, politics, and media.",

We'll read in Greek selections from two essays: Philo of Alexandria's On the Virtues and Plutarch's On the Virtue of Women. Philo (c. 20 a.C.- c. 46 d.C.) is a crucial figure in the tradition of Biblical exegesis and Plutarch (c. 46 d.C.- c. 120 d.C.) was regarded as a major authority down to the nineteenth century. Both writers are now the focus of intense scholarly attention.",

It introduces students to China’s geography and identifies contemporary environmental problems (including air, water and soil pollution, biodiversity loss, etc.) as well as their proposed solutions. Considering China’s recent history of rapid economic growth and stark socio-economic inequalities, a central objective of the course is to develop tools to effectively locate environmental issues within a broader political, social and economic context — a skill transposable to other geographical and environmental contexts. We will draw on scholarship from geography, anthropology, political science, and environmental science.",

In order to explore these topics we will examine films in relation to academic, autobiographical, and popular texts, all of which provide different ways of representing the past.",

Deciding when a local epidemic becomes a global emergency or calculating the economic value of healthy childbirth are not straightforward processes.

Why have such monuments been \"used\" by authorities and diverse social groups in the service of often totalitarian agendas? What are the cases where these monuments operate as weapons for resistance? How has colonial, racial, and national modernity shaped the way we understand and experience the materiality of the classical? Finally, how can we decolonize classical antiquity? We will use a diversity of global case studies, including modern Greece and Europe, and a variety of sources, from ethnographically derived performances to digital culture.",

How is attending related to consciousness, awareness, and the unconscious? What role does attentiveness play in agency and embodied action? How can attention be cultivated and shaped? Can we attend too much or too little, too narrowly or too widely, or even in the wrong ways?",

This course investigates claims about democracy through historical and philosophical readings. What exactly is democracy? How is it justified (or not)? How is democracy related to representation, gender, and class? We investigate these questions through Burke, Paine, Wollstonecraft, deTocqueville, Marx, Mill, Taylor, and Nietzsche.",

For example, while governments are often cajoled and enjoined to produce economic growth, especially during recessions, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering these things is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests that like these areas of policy just as they are, and they work to keep them “hard problems.”",

Our interdisciplinary inquiries on these questions will include concrete legal disputes in domestic and international courts; theoretical debates over the construction of “religion” in fields such as anthropology, religious studies, and philosophy; and historiographical controversies about the relationship between “secularization” and sovereignty, particularly in light of the legacy of colonialism.",

For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, \"why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?",
