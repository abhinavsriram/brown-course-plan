In this course, small-group discussion, laboratory, and field exercises will complement lectures, leading to an understanding of how anthropologists study the past and how that knowledge affects the present.",

We'll consider how language creates and reinforces social inequality and difference, how language promotes and resists globalization, and how language is used creatively in performance, literature, film, advertising, and mass media. We will also consider how language does important social work in specific contexts, such as classrooms, courtrooms, medical settings, and political campaigns.",

When trying to reconcile these perspectives, how can we account for powerful dynamics of race, gender, class, religion, and cultural difference? Finally, how can we develop a code of ethics that takes these issues into account and also is fundamentally connected to everyday life?",

    "Course Name": "The Biology of Aging",
    "Course Capacity": 20,
    "Course Description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span Р the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease Р has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" Р the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

This interdisciplinary course will insist on the global dimension of crisis, analyzing how modernist artists in the metropolis and the periphery represented this situation in different, yet overlapping ways. We will also examine how modernist works provide unique ways of thinking about what is lost in a moment of crisis and what potential may arise out of it. Authors will include: Eliot, Huidobro, Dos Passos, Woolf, Galv‹o, Arlt and Faulkner.",

The 1970s saw a global economy defined increasingly by deindustrialization, intensified competition, financialization, and squeezes on profitably. For workers, these changes meant that technological development, agrarian change, debt, and increasing precarity have transformed who works, where they work, and the sorts of politics that work (or its absence) gives rise to. This course examines these wider concerns within the context of the Middle East. Through a focus on social history and ethnographic accounts, it illuminates the ways different groups of workers experience and grapple with these broader transformations.",

Guiding questions include: How does youth civic engagement affect youthХs understandings of themselves, their civic identity, and belonging? How do youth engage in their communities?

The course uses ethnographic cases to explore: 1) how time, place, and social context affect youthХs engagement and notions of citizenship and 2) what transferable insights about citizenship, engagement, and change can be gleaned from study across contexts.",

By then, ancient Egypt had already established a complex body of literature that continued to develop over the next several millennia. This course examines literary, religious, historical, and philosophical writings from ancient Egypt, ranging in date from 2400 to 250 BCE, in order to investigate how those texts can enrich our understanding of Egyptian culture and how they relate to broader literary traditions from the ancient world. Selected texts include adventure tales, love poetry, myths, and autobiographies. No prerequisites.",

Rather its users and applications remain primarily large and institutional.\n\nTo experience the challenges of engineering design and of changing an industrial paradigm, we will work in one or several groups to identify a use of space, and a plan for its implementation, that could help transition space from its status as a niche technology. Through the process of design, we will confront the technical, economic, societal and political barriers to obtaining increased benefits from technologies in general, and space in particular, and to making new technologies beneficial to a wider range of users.

By looking to literary texts and cultural objects from the 20th to 21st centuries, this course considers how non-normative sex and gender function within spaces beset by colonial, racist, and nationalist legacies and how queerness imagines being within and without these structures. Readings and discussion will be in Spanish with an option to write papers in English for non-concentrators or concentrators fulfilling one of their English-language courses.",

How do particularly gendered, sexualized, raced, and classed bodies experience borders and mobility across them? Why are borders important sites of political, socio-cultural, economic, and religious contestation? How do borders and border-crossers matter to nation-states and global flows of capital and commodities? How do people living in border zones relate to the geopolitical reality of the border and the sociocultural and historical connections that often run across them? How do ideas about belonging and identity structure competing visions of justice, community, and citizenship?",

Economic inequality is increasing, austerity and welfare reforms have undermined social protections. Globalization and decades of permissive merger policies have resulted in private companies of unprecedented size and in possession of extraordinary market power and political influence. Climate change has called into question economic foundations and social compromises of post-war capitalism, while threatening to unleash destabilizing catastrophes. Populist parties are on the rise across Europe and North America, posing a direct challenge to the liberal order and creating new uncertainty about the future of liberal democracy and global capitalism.",

Examining the history of gender and family allows us to examine the limits of patriarchal control and construct a new, often surprising picture of how Jewish society actually functioned.

Over the course of the semester we will be thinking critically about texts, their ideological, historical and social coordinates and their embedded discourses of Greekness, community, diglossia, identity and gender, among others. In addition to translating from Greek into English, we will read and discuss essays on translation, in order to consider in an informed way the issues (untranslatability?) and types of decision making associated with the practice of translation. Three years of study of MGRK at Brown (equivalent of MGRK 0600) or elsewhere. A placement test may be necessary.",

He was at the same a powerful though elusive personality who continues to inspire critical controversy. We will examine his creative evolution in the context of the history of popular music taste, race relations, gender roles, and social class in America.

This course challenges the traditional ТcanonУ of western political thought by recovering a longСand often forgottenСhistory of debates, ideas, and texts written by, about, and for women. This course is intended for upper-division undergraduate students. Its methodological approach emphasizes close readings of texts in their historical context, but also draws on the approaches of contemporary feminist political philosophy as a framework for discussion and debate.",

Even though the dire conflicts of religion which fuel wars and civil unrest appear to be a thing of the past, fundamental moral disagreements are still plentiful today. These disagreements expose tensions among the core of ideas upon which liberal societies are built. This course explores moral pluralism and engages with questions such as: should the state be neutral in relation to different religious and moral convictions? Are there common values? How should citizens engage with each other when they debate controversial moral questions in the public forum?",

Their profoundly influential ideas about justice, freedom, democracy and racism, along with their activist strategies and personal biographies have generated extraordinary interest over the past 50 years. Despite this, the rich and complex tradition out of which their ideas and world-views evolve; the 300 year old religious strategies and practices employed by African-Americans have been understudied, disconnected from our understanding of their significance. This course will examine these traditions and these two central figuresХ roles within them in order to shed important light on both.",

The technologies discussed will range from the steam power leading to the 19th century industrial revolution to todayХs mobile phone technologies, workforce automation, but also facial-recognition technology and spyware.",
